# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

**Follow up**:
Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Example 1:
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,3,2]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```
