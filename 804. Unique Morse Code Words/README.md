# 804. Unique Morse Code Words

International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: `"a"` maps to `".-"`, `"b"` maps to `"-..."`, `"c"` maps to `"-.-."`, and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
```
[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
```

Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + ".-" + "-..."). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

**Note**:

- The length of `words` will be at most `100`.
- Each `words[i]` will have length in range `[1, 12]`.
- `words[i]` will only consist of lowercase letters.

**Follow up**:

- Can you solve it using only one pass?
- Can you solve it in `O(1)` space?

### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".
```
