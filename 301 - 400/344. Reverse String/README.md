# 344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Constraints**:
- <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
