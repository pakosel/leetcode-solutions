# 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Example 1:
```
Input: "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```
